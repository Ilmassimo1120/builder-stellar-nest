# ChargeSource File Storage Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring file storage in the ChargeSource Supabase database, enabling secure and efficient file management for the application.

## üìã Overview

The ChargeSource file storage system provides:
- **Secure file uploads** with user authentication
- **Role-based access control** for file permissions
- **Categorized storage** for different file types
- **File size and type validation** (max 50MB per file)
- **Real-time file management** with upload progress tracking
- **Admin controls** for managing all files across the system

## üîß Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ Active Supabase project (Project ID: `tepmkljodsifaexmrinl`)
- ‚úÖ Admin access to your Supabase dashboard
- ‚úÖ ChargeSource application deployed and running
- ‚úÖ User authentication system configured

## üöÄ Step 1: Create Storage Bucket in Supabase Dashboard

### 1.1 Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to your ChargeSource project (`tepmkljodsifaexmrinl`)

### 1.2 Create the Storage Bucket
1. In the left sidebar, click **"Storage"**
2. Click **"Create a new bucket"**
3. Configure the bucket with these settings:

```
Bucket Name: charge-source-files
Public: No (Private bucket for security)
File Size Limit: 50 MiB
Allowed MIME Types: 
  - image/jpeg
  - image/png
  - image/gif
  - image/webp
  - application/pdf
  - text/plain
  - application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document
  - application/msword
  - application/vnd.ms-excel
  - application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet
  - text/csv
  - application/zip
  - application/x-zip-compressed
```

4. Click **"Create bucket"**

## üîí Step 2: Configure Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### 2.1 Enable RLS on Storage Objects
In the Supabase SQL editor, run:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2.2 Create Security Policies
Run the following SQL commands to set up the security policies:

```sql
-- Policy: Users can upload files (authenticated users only)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload files" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' 
  AND bucket_id = 'charge-source-files'
);

-- Policy: Users can view their own files and public files
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'charge-source-files' 
  AND (
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
    OR (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'public'
    OR EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.users 
      WHERE id = auth.uid() 
      AND role IN ('admin', 'global_admin', 'sales')
    )
  )
);

-- Policy: Users can update their own files
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their files" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE USING (
  bucket_id = 'charge-source-files' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy: Users can delete their own files  
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their files" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'charge-source-files' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

-- Policy: Admins can manage all files
CREATE POLICY "Allow admins to manage all files" ON storage.objects
FOR ALL USING (
  bucket_id = 'charge-source-files' 
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.users 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND role IN ('admin', 'global_admin')
  )
);
```

### 2.3 Create Utility Function for File Paths
```sql
-- Create function to generate secure file paths
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.generate_file_path(
  file_name TEXT,
  file_category TEXT DEFAULT 'general'
)
RETURNS TEXT
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  user_id UUID;
  clean_filename TEXT;
  timestamp_str TEXT;
  file_extension TEXT;
  base_name TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Get current user ID
  user_id := auth.uid();
  
  IF user_id IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'User must be authenticated';
  END IF;
  
  -- Clean filename and extract extension
  clean_filename := regexp_replace(file_name, '[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]', '_', 'g');
  file_extension := regexp_replace(clean_filename, '.*\.', '');
  base_name := regexp_replace(clean_filename, '\.[^.]*$', '');
  
  -- Generate timestamp
  timestamp_str := to_char(NOW(), 'YYYY-MM-DD_HH24-MI-SS');
  
  -- Return structured path: user_id/category/timestamp_filename.ext
  RETURN user_id::text || '/' || file_category || '/' || timestamp_str || '_' || base_name || '.' || file_extension;
END;
$$;
```

## üìÅ Step 3: File Organization Structure

The file storage system organizes files using this hierarchy:

```
charge-source-files/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {user_id}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ general/          # General purpose files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project/          # Project-related files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quote/            # Quote attachments
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product/          # Product documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/             # Personal user files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/               # Publicly accessible files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
```

### File Naming Convention
Files are automatically renamed using the pattern:
```
{user_id}/{category}/{timestamp}_{original_filename}.{extension}
```

Example: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/project/2024-01-15_14-30-25_site_plan.pdf`

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Application Integration

## üîê Step 5: Security Configuration

### 5.1 File Size and Type Validation
- **Maximum file size**: 50MB per file
- **Allowed file types**: 
  - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  - Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
  - Spreadsheets: XLS, XLSX, CSV
  - Archives: ZIP

### 5.2 Access Control Rules

**User Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ Upload files to personal folders
- ‚úÖ View/download own files
- ‚úÖ Delete own files
- ‚úÖ View public files
- ‚ùå Access other users' private files

**Admin Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ All user permissions
- ‚úÖ View/manage all files across the system
- ‚úÖ Upload to public category
- ‚úÖ Manage product documentation

**Sales Role Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ User permissions

## üìä Step 6: Monitoring and Analytics

### 6.1 Storage Usage Tracking
Monitor storage usage through:
- **Dashboard metrics**: Total files, storage used, recent uploads
- **Category breakdown**: Storage distribution across file categories
- **User analytics**: Per-user storage consumption

### 6.2 File Activity Logging
The system automatically logs:
- File upload events with metadata
- Download/access events
- File deletion events
- Permission changes

## üö® Step 7: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Upload Failures:**
- Verify user authentication status
- Check file size limits (50MB max)
- Ensure file type is in allowed MIME types list
- Confirm bucket permissions are configured correctly

**Permission Denied Errors:**
- Verify RLS policies are enabled and configured
- Check user role assignments in the users table
- Ensure file paths follow the correct naming convention

**Storage Quota Issues:**
- Monitor storage usage in Supabase dashboard
- Implement file cleanup policies for old files
- Consider upgrading Supabase plan for larger storage limits

### Debug Commands

Check storage bucket configuration:
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'charge-source-files';
```

View RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';
```

Check user file access:
```sql
SELECT name, created_at, updated_at, metadata 
FROM storage.objects 
WHERE bucket_id = 'charge-source-files' 
AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = '{user_id}';
```

## üîÑ Step 8: Backup and Recovery

### 8.1 Automated Backups
Supabase automatically provides:
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Available for 7 days (Pro plan)
- **Daily automated backups**: Stored securely by Supabase
- **Cross-region replication**: For enterprise plans

### 8.2 Manual Backup Procedures
For additional backup security:
1. Export file metadata from storage.objects table
2. Use Supabase CLI to download files:
   ```bash
   supabase storage download --bucket charge-source-files --path ./backup/
   ```
3. Store backup metadata and files in external storage

## üöÄ Step 9: Production Deployment

### 9.1 Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in production:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://tepmkljodsifaexmrinl.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
```

### 9.2 Performance Optimization
- **CDN Integration**: Supabase automatically provides CDN for file delivery
- **Signed URLs**: Use for secure, temporary file access
- **Batch Operations**: Upload multiple files in parallel for better performance
- **File Compression**: Implement client-side compression for large files

### 9.3 Monitoring in Production
Set up monitoring for:
- Storage usage and growth trends
- Upload/download performance metrics
- Error rates and failed operations
- User access patterns and security events

## üìö Step 10: API Documentation

### Authentication
All file operations require user authentication:
```typescript
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

### Upload Example
```typescript
const upload: FileUpload = {
  file: selectedFile,
  category: 'project',
  metadata: {
    projectId: 'project-123',
    description: 'Site survey photos'
  }
};

const result = await fileStorageService.uploadFile(upload, (progress) => {
  console.log(`Upload progress: ${progress.percentage}%`);
});
```

### Download Example
```typescript
const blob = await fileStorageService.downloadFile('user123/project/file.pdf');
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
// Use URL for download or display
```

### Access Control Example
```typescript
const hasPermission = await fileStorageService.checkFilePermissions('user123/project/file.pdf');
if (hasPermission) {
  // Proceed with file operation
}
```
