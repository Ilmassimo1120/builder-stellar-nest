    response: `üîå **Circuit Breaker Tripping Solutions**

**Common Causes:**
‚Ä¢ Overload condition (exceeding rated current)
‚Ä¢ Earth fault or insulation breakdown
‚Ä¢ Incorrect breaker sizing
‚Ä¢ Loose connections causing arcing

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check actual load vs breaker rating
2. Test insulation resistance (>1MŒ© to earth)
3. Inspect all connections for tightness
4. Verify correct breaker type (B, C, or D curve)

**Solutions:**
‚Ä¢ Reduce load or upgrade circuit capacity
‚Ä¢ Repair insulation faults
‚Ä¢ Tighten all connections to specified torque
‚Ä¢ Install appropriate breaker for inrush current

**Safety:** Always isolate power before any electrical work.`,
